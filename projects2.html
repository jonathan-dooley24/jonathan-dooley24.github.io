                <h1>Misty Robotics as a Learning Tool</h1>
                <p>
                    On the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, you can see a short summary introducing Misty and my work with the robot.
                    Here, I will emphasize a few points about my work with Useabot and programming the Misty robot as it applies to my 
                    Capstone project. Since Misty wasn't a project assigned through school work, there were no hard contraints. I was able 
                    to create something I found creative and fun - a silly song and dance that Misty can do to help cheer up the people she meets.
                    <br><br>
                    Working with Misty really helped me grasp the role and utility of JavaScript. I had very limited experience working with a
                    specialized SDK and libraries that are "plug-and-play" to help me achieve what I wanted the hardware of the robot to do.
                    This applies to my role in the Web Development team for the Capstone Project because we are using a wide ranging loadout of 
                    libraries and tools I had no prior experience with. I think that sometimes a developer's greatest skill is adapting to new 
                    tech and finding solutions made by others which can be applied to your task-at-hand. Programming with Misty helped be hone 
                    that skill and it has helped me contribute in a more meaningful way during the Capstone Project, Classy-Schedule.

                    A snippet of some example code I used to learn and play around with Misty's functionality is below.
                    Because the code was passed along to a start-up company I am no longer working with, I cannot share 
                    the source code I worked on. Public code examples from the Misty II SDK can be found here:

                <h1>Crime Statistics Dynamic Client and Server</h1>
                <p>
                    This project was assigned to me for a Web Development class. The goal was to create a server in a Node runtime that properly 
                    queries a database and returns JSON data, which could be formatted by a client app to display a map and a table containing crime data for the 
                    city of St. Paul, MN. I worked in a team with two other classmates, where we all worked on functionality for the entire application. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the code snippet below, you can see an example from the server-side code, where the database is being connected and GET requests are 
                    being handled and formatted into an API response. This practice has helped me use the Classy-Schedule API while developing for the Capstone Project.
                    <br><br>
                    This project taught me so much about how code exists on the web and it really sparked my passion for creating aesthetic and 
                    robust code for the web. I appreciated being able to learn web development from the perspective of a front-end and a back-end 
                    developer and this project tied those aspects together perfectly.

                <h1>3D Graphics Wireframe Scene</h1>
                <p>
                    In a Computer Graphics course, I was able to learn a lot about 3D graphics and how they are rendered to a screen. I gained a new 
                    appreciation for the CGI we enjoy today after I took a look into the math underlying the visualization of even basic scenes. 
                    In this project, I was supplied formulas to use creatively to create a wireframe scene of a basic blocky house.
                    <br><br>
                    I worked independently to create my code for this project, utilizing tools like OpenGL. Understanding the view and scene control 
                    was difficult and the matrix math necessary to create a perspective view was trickey, but the result was very rewarding. This project 
                    helped me appreciate the power of coding and it also helped me gain some artistic and creative outlets for the possibilities of my own 
                    code outside of conventional practice. Thinking outside-the-box (no graphics pun intended), is a useful skill for any programmer and it 
                    has helped me be a more well-rounded developer while working on the Capstone Project.

                <h1>German Product Description Project</h1>
                <p>
                    In my level 3 German Class, one of my assignments was to describe a product from the German speaking world in detail. 
                    This included all the steps of creating, packaging, and selling the project. While making Beer-Steins and software are 
                    vastly different tasks, communicating the process of creation is really the same thing. You need to be able to communicate
                    high-level concepts to other people if you want to be a great developer. This project was great practice at hitting home 
                    the major important aspects for an audience. 
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking in another language was an added bonus! Coding is a global endeavor. I have worked with people from several different 
                    countries in past internships - Germany included. It is important now more than ever that developers are well-rounded and it 
                    is a huge benefit to have proficiency an another spoken language. While german-speaking hasn't applied to Classy-Schedule and 
                    my work on the Capstone Project, this project has helped me strengthen my skills at articulating ideas and processes to an audience.
